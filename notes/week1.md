# Machine Learning Algorithms

## 1. Supervised Learning  
- Most used in real-world applications  
- Covered in Course 1 & 2  
- Involves training on labeled data  

## 2. Unsupervised Learning  
- Finds hidden patterns or groupings in data  
- Covered in Course 3  

## 3. Recommender Systems  
- Used in platforms like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon  
- Personalized suggestions  

## 4. Reinforcement Learning  
- Agent learns by trial & error through rewards and penalties  
- Example: self-driving cars, game AI

### Extra Notes
- Machine Learning = field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  
- Arthur Samuel (1950s): Defined ML and created a checkers-playing program.

## superwised learning
- refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings.
-  The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from.
