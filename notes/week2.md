# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning — Summary & Notes

> _“Unsupervised learning is just as super as supervised learning!”_

---

## 🔍 What is Unsupervised Learning?

- In **supervised learning**, we’re given input data **with labels**.
  - Example: Predicting if a tumor is **benign or malignant**.
- In **unsupervised learning**, we’re given input data **without any labels**.
  - Example: Tumor data with **no diagnosis info** — just features like **size** and **age**.

---

## 🎯 Goal of Unsupervised Learning

> Discover **patterns**, **structures**, or **interesting relationships** in the data — **without supervision**.

---

## 📊 Example 1: Clustering

### 📌 Scenario:
- Dataset: Tumor size vs. age — **no labels** (benign/malignant).
- Objective: Find **groups or patterns** within the data.

### 🧭 Algorithm:
- A **clustering algorithm** assigns data points into **groups** (clusters).
- These clusters are **inferred** from the data structure.

### 🔍 Visualization:

```plaintext
+-----------+    +-----------+
| Cluster 1 |    | Cluster 2 |
|           |    |           |
|  o o o    |    |    x x x  |
|  o o o    |    |    x x x  |
+-----------+    +-----------+
```

## 🌐 Real-Life Application 1: Google News

### 📰 Problem:
- Google News scans **hundreds of thousands of articles daily**.

### 🤖 Clustering Use:
- Groups related articles into **topic clusters**.
- Example cluster:
  - “Panda gives birth to rare twin cubs”
  - Other articles mentioning **panda**, **twin**, **zoo**

> The algorithm learns on its own — **no human tells it** what topics to group.

## 🧬 Real-Life Application 2: Genetic Clustering

### 🧫 DNA Microarray Data:
- **Columns**: Individual people  
- **Rows**: Specific genes  
- **Colors**: Gene expression level (e.g. red, green, gray)

### 🧠 What clustering does:
- Finds **groups of similar individuals** based on gene activity.
- Example:
  - **Type 1**: Red-green gene pattern
  - **Type 2**: Mostly gray
  - **Type 3**: Mixed pattern

> The algorithm figures out clusters **without knowing** the traits beforehand.

## 🛍️ Real-Life Application 3: Market Segmentation

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Dataset:
- Customer behavior (no labels)
- Example: deep learning.ai learners

### 🎯 Clustering Output:
- Cluster 1: Learners who want to **gain knowledge**.
- Cluster 2: Learners focused on **career advancement**.
- Cluster 3: People who want to **stay updated** on AI in their field.

|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Supervised**        | ✅ Yes           | Predict output (Y)               | Tumor classification            |
| **Unsupervised**      | ❌ No            | Discover patterns/structure      | Clustering of news, genes, users|

---

## 🧠 Key Concept: Clustering

> **Clustering** is a type of **unsupervised learning** that groups **unlabeled data** based on similarity.

- It helps discover:
  - Customer segments
  - Genetic types
  - News topics
  - And much more...

# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning Overview

## What Is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is given data **without labeled outputs**. Unlike supervised learning, which uses input-output pairs \((x, y)\), unsupervised learning uses only inputs \((x)\) and tries to discover patterns, structures, or insights from the data.

---

## 🔍 Types of Unsupervised Learning

### 1. Clustering
Groups similar data points together.  
**Example**: Grouping news articles by topic.

### 2. Anomaly Detection
Identifies unusual or rare events.  
**Example**: Detecting fraudulent transactions in financial systems.

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction
Compresses high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions while preserving key information.  
**Example**: Reducing features for visualization or faster processing.

## ✅ Quiz: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

Here are four examples. Two are unsupervised learning problems, and two are supervised learning problems:

| Example                        | Type of Learning     | Explanation |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Spam filtering                | Supervised           | Uses labeled data: spam vs non-spam. |
| News story clustering         | Unsupervised         | Groups articles without labels. |
| Market segmentation           | Unsupervised         | Finds customer groups from unlabeled data. |
| Diagnosing diabetes           | Supervised           | Uses labeled outcomes: diabetes or not. |
